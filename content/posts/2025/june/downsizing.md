As I mentioned [here](/posts/2025/june/ai-get-fit/), I have been on a journey to get in shape. I have been working hard at it for several months now, and I am happy to report that I have officially lost 50 pounds (22.7 kg)! In this post, I want to share what has worked for me so far. I am not a doctor or a nutritionist, but I have found that these habits have helped me transform my health. If you are on a similar journey, I hope my experience can offer some inspiration!

## The Journey So Far

Since I began this latest weight loss process, I have been focused on one thing: consistency. I have been working out at least five days a week, and I have been tracking my food intake daily. I have been using a combination of strength training and walking to help me reach my goals. I'm not sure what has given me the motivation to stick with it this time, but I've been able to stay consistent and make progress.

I am not ready to share my starting weight (or my current weight). Still, I will share that information when I hit another significant milestone. I now weigh less than at any time in the last 15 years or so. I have clothes that barely fit me when I started, and now they're too big, but I feel better than I have in a long time. I have more energy, and I am sleeping better. I am also able to do things that I could not do in a long time, such as walking up a flight of stairs without getting winded.

## The Tools I Use

It will not surprise anyone who knows me, but I have decided to utilize as much technology as possible to help me reach my goals. I have been using a combination of apps and devices to track my progress and keep me motivated. Here are some of the tools I have found most helpful:

1. [Lose It!](https://www.loseit.com/) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lose-it-weight-loss-program/id297368629) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitnow.loseit&hl=en_US&gl=US)): This app has been my go-to for tracking my food intake and exercise. It allows me to set weight loss goals, log my meals, and track my calories. The barcode scanner makes it easy to log packaged foods, and the extensive food database helps me stay on track with my nutrition. It even connects with the apps listed below to pull in my activity data.
2. [Google Fit](https://www.google.com/fit/): I use Google Fit to track my daily activity, including steps taken, distance traveled, and "heart points". It syncs with my phone and smartwatch, making it easy to monitor my progress throughout the day.
3. [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strava-run-ride-walk/id426826309) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&hl=en_US&gl=US)): I use Strava to track my walks. It provides detailed statistics on my performance, including pace, distance, and elevation gain. I know Google Fit can track walks, but Strava seems to have better GPS tracking and more detailed stats. I also like the social aspect of Strava, as I can share my workouts with friends and see their progress.

## The "Diet"

Quite a few years ago, a doctor told me that when it comes to weight loss, "you lose pounds at the table and ounces at the gym." I have tried "diets" in the past—low-carb, low-fat, etc.—but I have found that the best approach for me is to focus on moderation and portion control. I do not deprive myself of foods I enjoy, but I try to be mindful of my portions and make healthier choices when possible. Lose It! has been instrumental in helping me track my food intake and stay accountable. I log everything I eat and try to stay within my daily calorie budget. I have found that tracking my food intake has made me more aware of what I am eating and has helped me make better choices.

One thing that has really helped me is intermittent fasting. I use a 14-hour fasting window, which means I eat during a 10-hour window each day. This has helped me control my calorie intake and avoid mindless snacking.

My biggest enemies have always been feeling hungry and late-night snacking. By using Lose It! to track my food intake, I have been able to avoid those late-night snacks that would derail my progress. To help alleviate feelings of hunger, I started taking Wegovy ([Website](https://www.wegovy.com/)). Wegovy is a prescription medication that helps with weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing feelings of fullness. It has been a game-changer for me, as it has helped me control my hunger and stick to my goals.

Lastly, I cut out sugary drinks and make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Lose It! also allows me to track my water intake. When I do drink something other than water, it is usually Zero Sugar Lemonade or Coke Zero. These drinks satisfy my cravings for something sweet without adding extra calories.

I am not suggesting anyone else take Wegovy or any other medication or drink "zero sugar" drinks. I am just sharing what has worked for me.

## The Exercises

I know that I will lose more weight if I focus on my diet, but I also know that exercise is an essential part of the equation. I have been using a combination of strength training and walking to help me reach my goals.

### Walking

For someone my size, walking is a great way to get started with exercise. When I started, I walked about 2 miles (3.2 km) a day, and I have gradually increased my distance as I have gotten stronger. I now walk about 3 miles (5 km) a day, and I do this at least 5 days a week. I use Strava to track my walks, and it helps me stay motivated and accountable. Recently, I have incorporated some light jogging into my walks, and I can jog for about .25 miles (not all at once, though).

I have routes that I walk through my neighborhood, varying in distance, and I decide which route to use based on how I feel that day, how much time I have, and the weather. There are parts of my neighborhood that are very flat and others that are very hilly, so I mix it up to keep things interesting. I also try to walk with my [older son](https://tylerstroz.com/) when I can, as it is a great way to spend time together and catch up on life. Spending that time with him is one of the best parts of my day.

With the help of Claude AI, I also put together a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4U9n4ql43u32WiYdt00Rko?si=2c2a2a7f85584467) of songs that have a consistent tempo to help me maintain a steady pace while I walk. Listening to music while I walk helps me stay motivated and makes the time pass more quickly.

It may take a while, but I would eventually like to run a 5K (3.1 miles) without stopping. I have never been a runner, but it would be a great goal to work towards.

### Strength Training

For my strength training, I use a combination of bodyweight exercises and an [adjustable kettlebell](amazon.com/dp/B0855H4ZCR?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2). For now, I am using a series of beginner exercises that I pieced together from various sources and use circuit training to keep my heart rate up. The exercises I chose are designed to provide a full-body workout. I aim to do strength training at least 3 days a week. Over the last few months, I have increased the weight I use, the number of reps in each set, and the number of circuits I do.

I also used Claude AI to help me compile two lists of exercises that will strengthen the muscles that can improve my golf game. These are focused on the lower body and upper body, respectively—though each has exercises to strengthen my core. I have not started these yet, but I plan to incorporate them into my routine soon. I will share more about these exercises in a future post.

## The Results (So far)

The results (so far) have been incredibly motivating. I feel better than I have in a long time, and many of the aches and pains I assumed were just a part of old age are easing up or are gone. I have a lot more energy. In the past, I used to think of excuses not to exercise or be active, but now I look for reasons to be active. There have been more than a few days when I felt I wasn't as active as I could have been (specifically, days when I did strength training), so I will go for a walk in the evening.

Playing 18 holes of golf used to exhaust me, even if I used a cart. Now, I typically go for a 3-mile walk after golf to ensure I get my "heart points" for the day.

I used to loathe mowing my lawn. My front yard is small but has some steep slopes. I used to struggle with mowing it, and I would be exhausted by the time I finished. While I can't say I like mowing the lawn, I can say it has become a lot easier.

I regularly track my blood pressure and heart rate and have noticed that both have improved significantly. My resting heart rate has dropped, and my blood pressure is well within the normal range.

I'm not done yet, but I'm excited about the progress I've made so far. I have a few more goals I want to reach, and I will share more about those in future posts. For now, I wanted to share my journey and what has worked for me so far.
