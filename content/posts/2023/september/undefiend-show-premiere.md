I would like each and every one of you to join me and my good friends, [Todd Sharp](https://recursive.codes/) and [Ray Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com/), when we launch our new live stream, [The Undefined Show](https://www.twitch.tv/theundefinedshow), on September 11, 2023 at 8:00 PM Eastern. We will discuss a broad range of topics, primarily related to tech, coding, developer relations, and anything else that comes to mind.

See you then!
