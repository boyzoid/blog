---

Over the last few years, I have become quite smitten with [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/). For those who may not be familiar with MySQL Shell, it is a new(ish) command line interface (CLI) for connecting to and managing MySQL instances. During a recent [episode](https://insidemysql.libsyn.com/mysql-shell-does-all-the-things) of [Inside MySQL: Sakila Speaks](https://insidemysql.libsyn.com/), Fred and I talked to Miguel Araujo about many of the helpful (and lesser known) features of MySQL Shell. This post is the tenth in a series about these "hidden gem" features.

## The Problem

I am going to share a problem I had that I wanted to use MySQL Shell to solve. I manage a golf league, and quite a few years ago, I wrote a web application to help me set up schedules, enter scores, etc. When troubleshooting an issue or adding new functionality, I prefer using the latest and most up-to-date data. So, I needed an easy way to pull data from the production server and restore it to the MySQL instance running on my laptop. I had an old shell script that used `mysqldump` to grab the data and the `mysql` command to import it. It worked, but I wanted to see if I could duplicate those tasks using MySQL Shell.

## The Solution

Before I explain everything I need to do, let me share the contents of the shell script, and then I will proceed step-by-step.

```shell
#!/bin/sh

rm -R ~/dumps/league_prod

mysqlsh --ssh ssh_user@gl-db-server --ssh-identity-file ~/.ssh/my_server myuser@localhost:3306 -- util dumpSchemas  golf_league_schema  --output-url ~/dumps/league_prod

mysqlsh scott@localhost -- util loadDump ~/dumps/league_prod --sessionInitSql 'drop schema if exists golf_league_manager' --skipBinLog true
```

In this example, I have MySQL 9.0 Community running on a remote Linux-based server.

### Clearing the Deck

Whenever we dump data using `util.dumpTables()`, `util.dumpSchemas()`, or `util.dumpInstance()`, the local directory we specify the dump should be put in must be emptyâ€”we can't do another dump in the same directory. I took the easy way out and decided to hard code the name of the directory in my script, `~/dumps/league_prod`.

With this in mind, I knew I needed to delete the `~/dumps/league_prod` folder before I tried to dump the data from production. For this reason, the first command in my script is:

```shell
rm -R ~/dumps/league_prod
```

### Grabbing Data From Production

Now that I have cleared out the directory where I want to store my dump, we can get down to grabbing the data from the remote server. Because I want to do this as part of a script that requires no interaction, I want to start MySQL Shell and do the dump in one single command rather than connecting to the server and then running `util.dumpSchemas()` from the Shell interface.

Fortunately, we can run MySQL Shell commands as part of a script or other CLI process. The syntax is a little different than if we were running the commands in the MySQL Shell interface.

Here is the command that will handle our dump.

```shell
mysqlsh --ssh ssh_user@gl-db-server --ssh-identity-file ~/.ssh/my_server myuser@localhost:3306 -- util dumpSchemas  golf_league_schema  --output-url ~/dumps/league_prod
```

There is a lot going on here, so I will address each item in the command one by one.

* `mysqlsh` - This part of the command tells my system to run the `mysqlsh` executable.
* `--ssh opc@gl-db-server` - This section of the command tells MySQL Shell to make an SSH connection with the user name `ssh_user` to the domain `gl-db-server` (which is an alias I have in my `hosts` file that points to the Ip address of my server)
* `--ssh-identity-file ~/.ssh/my_server` - This part of the command tells MySQL Shell where the private key is for connecting to `gl-db-server` over SSH.
* `--` - The purpose of this double dash is to tell MySQL Shell that we are done providing Shell options and that what follows needs to be passed to the command line integration.
    * The syntax for providing commands this way follows this syntax: `mysqlsh [options] -- [shell_object]+ object_method [arguments]`
* `util` - This part of the command tells MySQL Shell that we want to use the `util` global object.
* `dumpSchemas` - This section tells MySQL Shell that we want to run the `dumpSchemas()` method of the `util` object.
* `golf_league_schema` - This text Signifies the single schema we want to dump.
* `--output-url ~/dumps/league_prod` - Lastly, we specify the `output-url` for the dump. This directory is the same one we deleted above.
    * Note: This directory is on the machine where the script will be run (my laptop) and not on the remote server.

#### Getting Help

In a [previous post](/posts/2024/may/getting-help-mysql-shell/), I discussed the robust 'help' system in MySQL Shell. You will be happy to learn that this help system extends to using the commands above. To access Help for running commands this way, run the following at a command prompt:

```shell
mysqlsh -- --help
```

The output from this command will resemble the text below:

```text
The following objects provide command line operations:

   cluster
      Represents an InnoDB Cluster.

   clusterset
      Represents an InnoDB ClusterSet.

   dba
      InnoDB Cluster, ReplicaSet, and ClusterSet management functions.

   rs
      Represents an InnoDB ReplicaSet.

   shell
      Gives access to general purpose functions and properties.

   util
      Global object that groups miscellaneous tools like upgrade checker and
      JSON import.

```

This output contains a list of objects available when using MySQL Shell as part of a command-line operation.

To get more info about the `util` object, we would use the following command:

```shell
mysqlsh -- util --help
```

The output of this command will tell us what methods we can use through the command line.

```text
The following object provides command line operations at 'util':

   debug
      Debugging and diagnostic utilities.

The following operations are available at 'util':

   check-for-server-upgrade
      Performs series of tests on specified MySQL server to check if the
      upgrade process will succeed.

   copy-instance
      Copies a source instance to the target instance. Requires an open global
      Shell session to the source instance, if there is none, an exception is
      raised.

   copy-schemas
      Copies schemas from the source instance to the target instance. Requires
      an open global Shell session to the source instance, if there is none, an
      exception is raised.

   copy-tables
      Copies tables and views from schema in the source instance to the target
      instance. Requires an open global Shell session to the source instance,
      if there is none, an exception is raised.

   dump-instance
      Dumps the whole database to files in the output directory.

   dump-schemas
      Dumps the specified schemas to the files in the output directory.

   dump-tables
      Dumps the specified tables or views from the given schema to the files in
      the target directory.

   export-table
      Exports the specified table to the data dump file.

   import-json
      Import JSON documents from file to collection or table in MySQL Server
      using X Protocol session.

   import-table
      Import table dump stored in files to target table using LOAD DATA LOCAL
      INFILE calls in parallel connections.

   load-dump
      Loads database dumps created by MySQL Shell.
```

Lastly, if we want to get information about using `dumpSchemas()`, we would run the command:

```shell
mysqlsh -- util dumpSchemas --help
```

The (lengthy) output from this command will resemble the following:

```text

```

This output was very enlightening regarding how the command should be formatted, what options are available, and how those options should be provided.

In our example, we are only dumping a single schema, `golf_league_schema`, and saving the output to `~/dumps/league_prod`.

### Loading Data to Local Instance

Now that the data from production has been dumped into a directory on my local system, I need to load that data into the MySQL instance on my local system. Here is the command to handle that:

```shell
mysqlsh scott@localhost -- util loadDump ~/dumps/league_prod --sessionInitSql 'drop schema if exists golf_league_schema' --skipBinLog true
```

This command looks different than the first command. Let's break this down.

* `mysqlsh` - This part of the command tells my system to run the `mysqlsh` executable.
* `scott@localhost`â€”Since I do not need to connect over SSH, I am using a user named `scott` to connect to an instance running on `localhost`.
* `--` - The purpose of this double dash is to tell MySQL Shell that we are done providing Shell options and that what follows needs to be passed to the command line integration.
    * The syntax for providing commands this way follows this syntax: `mysqlsh [options] -- [shell_object]+ object_method [arguments]`
* `util` - This part of the command tells MySQL Shell that we want to use the `util` global object.
* `loadDump` - This section tells MySQL Shell that we want to run the `loadDump()` method of the `util` object.
* `~/dumps/league_prod` - This part of the command is the path to the directory that contains the dump.
* `--sessionInitSql 'drop schema if exists golf_league_manager'` - An option we have available when loading data from a dump is to run SQL statements before the load process begins. In this case, we use `sessioninitSql` to drop the `golf_league_schema` schema before loading the dump.
* `--skipBinLog true` - The `skipBinLog` option lets us turn off the bin log when importing a database dump. With large datasets, this can improve the performance of the load.

If you would like to get more information about these options or learn about how to pass other options when running `loadDump()` as part of a script or from the command line, use the following command:

```shell
mysqlsh -- util loadDump --help
```

### User Credentials

You may have noticed that I have not provided any user credentials for either of these connections. That is because my instance of MySQL Shell is configured to always save user credentials when I connect to a MySQL instance. One benefit of saving passwords in MySQL Shell is that when I run commands as part of a script, I do not need to include (or provide) the passwords as part of the process.


### The Results

When I run the script above, here is the output I see in my console:

## Wrap Up

Like `mysqldump` and `mysql` executables, MySQL Shell allows us to run commands as part of a scripted process. Because of the way I have MySQL Shell configured, I do not need to provide any passwords when I run this script (nor do I need to include them in the script itself). If you want to learn more about how to integrate MySQL Shell commands into a command line or scripted process, head on over to the [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/command-line-integration-overview.html).
