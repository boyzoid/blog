I am thrilled that I was selected to speak at the [JavaScript & Friends Conference](https://www.javascriptandfriends.com/) in Columbus, OH on July 29th.

I will be helping attendees understand the importance of writing tests for our code, how to identify what needs to be tested, how we go about writing the tests, and some guidelines for writing tests that ensure our code is working as we expect.

It has been a few years since I have spoken at a conference, so I am equal parts excited and nervous.

Hope to see you there!
