If it seems like this space was neglected for a while, well...that is because it was.

I started blogging again because I wanted to continue giving back to the communities I have been a part of for many years. My way of 'paying it forward, if you will.

I had aspirations to share content regularly, but unfortunately, life got in the way.

Back in late April, I got COVID. It was not very serious, but the symptoms lingered for longer than I would have expected.

And then, in mid-June, I got a new job!

I was hired by [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/) to be a Developer Advocate for [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

Things have been a bit of a whirlwind getting settled in the new gig. So far, I am loving it. I get to work with incredibly passionate and intelligent people. I am constantly being challenged and spend quite a bit of time learning more about a product I have used for over 20 years.

I have also been traveling more than I anticipated. I have been to events in Los Angeles twice in the last month where I had the opportunity to meet other members of the open source and database communities. I also have three more events planned for the remainder of the calendar year. There will be more information about my previous and upcoming events soon.

As you may have guessed, the content here will likely start to be more MySQL focussed, but there will also be general development and developer relations content in the mix.
