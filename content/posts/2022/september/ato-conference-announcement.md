I am excited to announce that I am speaking at [All Things Open](https://2022.allthingsopen.org/) this year.

The conference is November 1-2 in Raleigh, NC.

In [my session](https://javascript-conference.com/node-js/my-tests-passed-but-why-did-my-code-fail/) I will talk about how to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [MySQL Document Store](https://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/document_store.html).

If you are in/near Raleigh at this time, ping me, and maybe we can meet up.
