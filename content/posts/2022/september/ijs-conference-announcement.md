I am speaking at the [International JavaScript Conference](https://javascript-conference.com/new-york/) at the end of this month in Brooklyn, NY.

You may be wondering what MySQL has to do with JavaScript. Well, in [my session](https://javascript-conference.com/node-js/my-tests-passed-but-why-did-my-code-fail/) I will talk about how to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [MySQL Document Store](https://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/document_store.html).

For those who may not be familiar with MySQL Document Store, it is a "NoSQL" database that sits on top of MySQL. It offers a basic API for CRUD operations and allows you to use raw SQL to run reports more easily.

If you are in or around NYC the last week of September, ping me, and maybe we can meet up.

If you cannot make it to this conference, fear not. I am giving this presentation to [Sac Interactive](https://sacinteractive.com/) later this month. Details to follow.
