title: Who Am I?
---
Hi. My name is Scott Stroz and here is a little about me.

* I am a developer with over 20 years of experience in a variety of different languages.
  * My current interests include Vue.js and Micronaut
* I love to tinker.
* I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and I get excited about learning new things.
* I want to share my experiences so others can learn from my mistakes.
* I love dogs.
* I am an avid golfer.
* I spent 14 years as a paramedic before I started slinging code.
  * I think there are a lot of qualities shared between good paramedics and good coders.
* If I sound like I am from New Jersey, that is because I lived there for 35 years before I ~~escaped~~ moved.
* I was once the King of the circus.
* I bleed NY Giants blue.
* I don't believe adversity builds character, I believe adversity reveals character.
* I am fairly certain this is not the final version of this list.
